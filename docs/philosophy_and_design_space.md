# Philosophy and Design Space

## Foreword

Any proposal, solution, or technical implementation is built upon certain foundational assumptions - what we refer to as "design axioms".
These are core ideas, principles and mantras guiding our thinking processes, design and engineering. It helps to evaluate the feasibility
of different solutions and their respective effectiveness.

We like to believe that clearly stating the ideas and principles guiding our proposals help promote transparency and trust. Our effort to
refine and make our philosophy transparent allows us to establish a shared understanding of the reasoning behind our suggestions.
This process then helps framing discussion, collaboration and establishing expectations on why some ideas adhere to our "design axioms"
while others might not. It is not about enforcing a framework but rather about ensuring we stay principled, consistent, and thoughtful and focused on the objective.

We do recognize that no set of values is perfect or effective in every situation. We absolutely do welcome disagreements with
our "design axioms" and encourage dialogue. We want to know if an idea is flawed or is no longer relevant. Our work is strengthened
by collaborative work. Our dedication to a transparent workstream goes beyond explaining our logic. It's fundamentally about encouraging meaningful
participation and making sure that our foundations continue to be strong, current, and able to evolve.
